<div class="element-content"><p> Register a function to be run on module load.
 This is called every time a save file is loaded *except* for the instance when a mod is loaded into a save file that it previously wasn't part of.
 Additionally this is called when connecting to any other game in a multiplayer session and should never change the game state.</p><p> This is meant for 3 specific reasons and only 3:
 </p><ul><li> re-register conditional event handlers</li><li> re-setup meta tables</li><li> create local references to tables stored in the global table</li></ul><p> In all other instances the <a href="LuaBootstrap.html#LuaBootstrap.on_init">LuaBootstrap::on_init</a>, <a href="LuaBootstrap.html#LuaBootstrap.on_configuration_changed">LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed</a> or migration scripts should be used.
 Doing any other logic when loading a save file can break the replay and cause desync issues if the mod is used in multiplayer.
