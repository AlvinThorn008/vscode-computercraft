Register a function to be run on module load.
This is called every time a save file is loaded
*except* for the instance when a mod is loaded
into a save file that it previously wasn't part
of. Additionally this is called when connecting to
any other game in a multiplayer session and should
never change the game state.

 This is meant for 3 specific reasons and only 3: 

 *  re-register conditional event handlers
 *  re-setup meta tables
 *  create local references to tables stored in
   the global table

 In all other instances the LuaBootstrap::on_init
[LuaBootstrap.html#LuaBootstrap.on_init], 
LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed
[LuaBootstrap.html#LuaBootstrap.on_configuration_changed] 
or migration scripts should be used. Doing any
other logic when loading a save file can break the
replay and cause desync issues if the mod is used
in multiplayer.
